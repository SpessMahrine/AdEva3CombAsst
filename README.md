# AdEva3CombAsst
A chatbot plugin for running Adeptus Evangelion v3.05 combat via CLI that supports multiple users.

By default, you can just run it from a terminal for testing, but the intention is to plug it into a chatbot that provides the following:

  (1) Chat messages that are treated as commands. The "help" function assumes the chatbot will feed it any line that starts with a '?'. You can do whatever you want, but then change the help function.

  (2) The author of the chat message ('user'). Ideally a name to be human-readable since it is read back a few times, but can be an ID or anything else that can be personally identifiable. This is for light authentication: so that only the owners of a thing can tell it what to do. If your chat client allows multiple users to share the same name, then probably use some other kind of identifier that allows authentication or don't play with jerks.

  (3) The origin of the chat message ('channel name'). The main parser will return an array consisting of a message and where it thinks the response should go. You can, of course, ignore this when you go to print the message out, but this allows you to PM the bot your actions and for everyone to be able to see the result. Listen everywhere, speak in one place.

It should be possible to plug this into any kind of interface (GUI, web, whatever) if the interface provides the required three pieces of information. Youâ€™re on your own for that and for displaying the output coherently. 

Known issues:

  (1) Error handling. The basic terminal prompt is wrapped in a try/except statement so that data persists despite typos, but the handling is bad and there are other unhandled errors elsewhere.
  
  (2) Project is in an incomplete state. Nothing to do but wait or help.
  
Planned features, kind of in order:

  (1) Encapsulate everything in single Combat framework so that the same bot can run multiple combats.

  (2)	Encapsulate all players into Director framework that also handles GM permissions.
  
  (3) Sectors and Engagements framework build into Combat.
  
  (4) Action framework so that Actors can actually do things.
  
  (5)	Condition framework so that Actions can have results.
  
  (6)	Trigger framework. Tied heavily to Conditions and required to make Conditions work right.
  
  (7)	Initiative framework. So that Rounds and Intervals advance correctly.
  
  (8) Save/load functions that offload everything to file(s).
  
  (9) Character creation function that creates a loadable character.
  
  (10) Some sort of GUI option, which will likely be a fork of this project into a standalone application in case you want to play with people IRL instead of online.
